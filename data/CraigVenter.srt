1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before,

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
about the human genome and what that might mean,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and discovering new sets of genes.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're actually starting at a new point:

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we've been digitizing biology,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and now we're trying to go from that digital code

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
into a new phase of biology,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
with designing and synthesizing life.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
have been trying to understand

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
at various levels.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We've tried various approaches,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
paring it down to minimal components.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:61,000
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years.

16
00:00:61,000 --> 00:00:63,000
When we sequenced the human genome,

17
00:00:63,000 --> 00:00:66,000
it was going from the analog world of biology

18
00:00:66,000 --> 00:00:70,000
into the digital world of the computer.

19
00:00:70,000 --> 00:00:74,000
Now we're trying to ask, can we regenerate life,

20
00:00:74,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or can we create new life,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
out of this digital universe?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is the map of a small organism,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mycoplasma genitalium,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that has the smallest genome for a species

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that can self-replicate in the laboratory.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And we've been trying to just see if

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we can come up with an even smaller genome.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're able to knock out on the order of a hundred genes

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
out of the 500 or so that are here.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But when we look at its metabolic map,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it's relatively simple

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
compared to ours.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Trust me, this is simple.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But when we look at all the genes

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that we can knock out one at a time,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it's very unlikely that this would yield

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
a living cell.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, we decided the only way forward

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
was to actually synthesize this chromosome

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so we could vary the components

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
to ask some of these most fundamental questions.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And so we started down the road of,

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"Can we synthesize a chromosome?"

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Can chemistry permit making

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 these really large molecules

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
where we've never been before?

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And, if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
at an exponential pace.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Our ability to write the genetic code

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
has been moving pretty slowly,

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but has been increasing.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And our latest point would put it on now an exponential curve.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We started this over 15 years ago.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It took several stages, in fact,

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But it turns out synthesizing DNA

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is very difficult.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's tens of thousands of machines around the world

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
that make small pieces of DNA,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 30 to 50 letters in length,

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the more errors there are.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So we had to create a new method

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
of the genome of Phi X 174.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We designed the pieces, went through our error correction,

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and had a DNA molecule

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
of about 5,000 letters.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and put it in the bacteria,

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 made the viral particles.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The viral particles then were released from the cells,

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
then came back and killed the E. coli.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was talking to the oil industry recently,

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and I said they clearly understood that model.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
(Laughter)

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They laughed more than you guys are.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And so we think this is a situation

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
where the software can actually build its own hardware

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 in a biological system.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But we wanted to go much larger.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's over 580,000 letters of genetic code.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses,

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
so we could actually vary the cassettes

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 to understand

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
what the actual components of a living cell are.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Design is critical,

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that digital information has to be really accurate.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We actually found, on resequencing it,

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
30 errors. Had we used that original sequence,

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it never would have been able to be booted up.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Part of the design is designing pieces

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that are 50 letters long

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to build smaller sub-units

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
we have to design so they can go together.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We design unique elements into this.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You may have read that we put watermarks in.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Think of this:

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G and T.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Triplets of that letter -- those letters

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
code for roughly 20 amino acids --

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that there's a single letter designation

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
for each of the amino acids.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So we can use the genetic code to write out words,

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
sentences, thoughts.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Initially, all we did was autograph it.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We designed these pieces so

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we can just chew back with enzymes.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's enzymes that repair them and put them together.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And we started making pieces,

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
starting with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters,

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
fit those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
then put sets of those, going up to 72,000.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
so we could sequence them

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust --

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that you can see in a minute.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're trying to get to the point of automation.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, this looks like a basketball playoff.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When we get into these really large pieces --

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
over 100,000 base pairs --

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And so we turned to other mechanisms.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination,

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that biology uses to repair DNA,

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 that can put pieces together.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Here's an example of it.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There's an organism called

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Deinococcus radiodurans

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that can take three millions rads of radiation.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
12 to 24 hours later, it put it

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
back together exactly as it was before.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
These organisms can be totally desiccated.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
They can live in a vacuum.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
move around, find a new aqueous environment.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
using these processes -- actually just using yeast mechanisms

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
with the right design of the pieces we put them in.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeast puts them together automatically.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is not an electron micrograph;

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
this is just a regular photomicrograph.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's such a large molecule

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we can see it with a light microscope.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
These are pictures over about a six-second period.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So this is the publication we had just a short while ago.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's over 300 million molecular weight.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If we printed out at a 10 font with no spacing,

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it takes 142 pages

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
just to print this genetic code.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's also simpler when you go

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 into eukaryotes like ourselves:

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you can just pop out the nucleus

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and pop in another one,

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
With bacteria archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
of a chromosome from one cell to another

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and activate it.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We added a few extra genes

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
so we could select for this chromosome.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We digested it with enzymes

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to kill all the proteins.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and you'll appreciate

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
our very sophisticated graphics here --

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the new chromosome went into the cell.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
but we tried to design the process a little bit further.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We find all kinds of species

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that have taken up a second chromosome

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
or a third one from somewhere,

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
adding thousands of new traits

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 in a second to that species.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So people who think of evolution

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
as just one gene changing at a time

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
have missed much of biology.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's enzymes called restriction enzymes

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that actually digest DNA.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The chromosome that was in the cell

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
doesn't have one.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The cell -- the chromosome we put in -- does.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It got expressed, and it recognized

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the other chromosome as foreign material,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
chewed it up, and so we ended up

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
just with the cell with the new chromosome.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And with a very short period of time,

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
all the characteristics of one species were lost,

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and it converted totally into the new species,

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
based on the new software that we put in the cell.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All the proteins changed,

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the membranes changed --

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So this may sound like genomic alchemy,

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
but we can, by moving the software DNA around,

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
change things quite dramatically.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Now, I've argued, this is not genesis --

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution,

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and I've argued that we're about to perhaps

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 create a new version of the Cambrian explosion

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
where there's massive new speciation

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
based on this digital design.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why do this?

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We're about to go from six and a half

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
to 9 billion people over the next 40 years.

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
To put it in context for myself:

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was born in 1946.

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's now three people on the planet

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
for every one of us that existed in 1946;

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
within 40 years, there'll be four.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
medicines, fuel

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
for the six and a half billion.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We use over 5 billion tons of coal,

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
30 billion-plus barrels of oil.

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's a hundred million barrels a day.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When we try to think of biological processes

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
or any process to replace that,

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
it's going to be a huge challenge.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Then, of course, there's all that

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CO2 from this material

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
that ends up in the atmosphere.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We now, from our discovery around the world,

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 have a database with about 20 million genes,

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and look at the diversity that came out of that.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We're limited here primarily

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
by a biological reality

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and our imagination.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We now have techniques,

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
because of these rapid methods of synthesis,

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We have the ability now to build a large robot

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that can make a million chromosomes a day.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes,

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or trying to optimize processes

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
new vaccines,

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
we can change, just with a small team,

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
do more molecular biology

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
than the last 20 years of all science.

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it's just standard selection.

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We can select for viability,

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
chemical or fuel production,

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
vaccine production, et cetera.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is a screen snapshot

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
of some true design software

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that we're working on to actually be able to sit down

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and design species in the computer.

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We know exactly what their genetic code looks like.

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You've seen recently corn to ethanol

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
is just a bad experiment.

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We have second- and third-generation fuels

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that will be coming out relatively soon

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
like octane or different types of butanol.

286
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But the only way we think that biology

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
can have a major impact without

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road,

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
in about 18 months.

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Sunlight and CO2 is one method --

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
(Applause)

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
-- but in our discovery around the world,

296
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
we have all kinds of other methods.

297
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is an organism we described in 1996.

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It lives in the deep ocean,

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
about a mile and a half deep,

300
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
almost at boiling-water temperatures.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It takes CO2 to methane

302
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We're looking to see if we can take

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
captured CO2,

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
which can easily be piped to sites,

306
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
convert that CO2 back into fuel,

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to drive this process.

308
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So in a short period of time,

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
we think that we might be able to increase

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
what the basic question is of "What is life?"

311
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We're truly, you know --

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
have modest goals

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 (Laughter) (Applause)

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you?

316
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
(Laughter)

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Become a major source of energy.

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But also, we're now working on using these same tools

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to come up with instant sets of vaccines.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You've seen this year with flu,

321
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
we're always a year behind and a dollar short

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
when it comes to the right vaccine.

323
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I think that can be changed

324
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Here's what the future may begin to look like

326
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
speeding up evolution

328
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 with synthetic bacteria, archea,

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and eventually eukaryotes.

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We're a ways away from improving people.

331
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
(Applause)
